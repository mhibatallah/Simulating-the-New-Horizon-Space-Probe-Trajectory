## Simulation of the New Horizon Space Probe

This project was part of my numerical project during my undergraduate studies.

The intergration of Newton equations was mainly done using the symplectic and adaptive verlet scheme.

For more information about the description of the project and about how the simulation of the space prob was done, you can read the Python notebooks (**in french**):
